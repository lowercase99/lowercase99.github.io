    <p>Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan, invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snurfer">"snurfer"</a> (combining snow and surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed the idea to a manufacturer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_Corporation">Brunswick Corporation</a>, that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade. And, in 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were sold.[4] Later versions of the "snurfer" were flat planks of wood with a pointed bent upward tip with a rope connected to help keep control of the board and later models closer to the modern snowboard made up of various components.</p>
    <p>The development of snowboarding was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skateboarding">skateboarding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledding">sledding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing">surfing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing">skiing</a>. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s, became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympic_Games">Winter Olympic Sport</a> at Nagano in 1998[1] and eventually was featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014.[2] Its popularity (as measured by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.</p>
    
    <h1 id="DifferentStylesofSnowboarding">Different Styles of Snowboarding</h1>
    

    <p>Since snowboarding's inception as an established winter sport, it has developed various styles, each with its own specialized equipment and technique. The most common styles today are: freeride, freestyle, and freecarve/race. These styles are used for both recreational and professional snowboarding. While each style is unique, there is overlap between them.</p>

    <h2>Jibbing</h2>

    <p>"Jibbing" is the term for technical riding on non-standard surfaces, which usually includes performing tricks. The word "jib" is both a noun and a verb, depending on the usage of the word. As a noun: a jib includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete ledges, walls, vehicles, rocks and logs.</p>
    <img id="first" src="https://www.deervalleyspecialist.com/uploads/agent-2/park-city-terrain-park-1.jpg" alt="Jibbing" class="center">


    <h2>Freeriding</h2>  

    <p>Freeriding is a style without a set of governing rules or set course, typically on natural, un-groomed terrain. The basic allows for various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion and spontaneity through naturally rugged terrain. It can be similar to freestyle with the exception that no man-made features are utilized</p>

    class="center">


    <h2>Alpine Snowboarding</h2>

    <p>Alpine snowboarding is a discipline within the sport of snowboarding.[31] It is practiced on groomed pistes. It has been an Olympic event since 1998.</p>
    <p>Sometimes called freecarving or hardbooting(due to the equipment used), this discipline usually takes place on hard packed snow or groomed runs(although it can be practiced in any and all conditions) and focuses on carving linked turns, much like surfing or longboarding, and is seen as superior to other disciplines in many Europeans countries.</p>
    <img src="https://www.gbxsquad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_6721.jpg" alt="Alpine Snowboarding" width="300" height="200" class="center">


    <h2>Big air</h2>

    <p>Big air competitions are contests where riders perform tricks after launching off a man made jump built specifically for the event. Competitors perform tricks in the air, aiming to attain sizable height and distance, all while securing a clean landing. Many competitions also require the rider to do a complex trick. But not all competitions call for a trick to win the gold; some intermittent competitions are based solely on height and distance of the launch of the snowboarder. </p>

    <h2>Half-pipe</h2>

    <p>The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch dug into the mountain or purpose-built ramp made up of snow, with walls between 8 and 23 feet (7.0 m). Competitors perform tricks while going from one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of the pipe.</p>

    <h1 id="begginigofsnowboardingincalifornia">Beggining of Snowboarding in California</h1>
  

    <P>The first known terrain park (then called a ‘snowboard park’) was built at Bear Valley Ski Area (California) in the 1989-90 season. It was the brainchild of Bear Valley's Marketing Director Sean McMahon and California snowboarder and contest organizer Mike McDaniel.

        McMahon's idea was to create an area of the mountain specifically for snowboarders—modeled after the skateparks of the 1970s, featuring jumps, jibs, and a halfpipe—that would bring new customers to the small, family operated ski area in the Central Sierra. He enlisted the help of McDaniel, who had experience building snowboard-specific terrain features such as halfpipes and jumps, through his work organizing early snowboard events. McDaniel in turn, brought in snowboard pioneers Mike Chantry and Keith Kimmel to consult on the design and construction of the park, to be located on the front side of Bear Valley's upper mountain.
        
        A surface lift was installed to bring snowboarders from the bottom of the area back to the top, without having to take a chair lift to the top of the mountain. Kim Krause, who had run lifts in other areas of the resort, was brought on as the park's first lift operator.
        
        It became apparent that the park would need ongoing construction, grooming, and maintenance, and McDaniel was hired by <a href="https://www.bearvalley.com/plan-your-visit/directions/">Bear Valley</a> in the fall of 1989 to be Snowboard Park Manager. The new mountain attraction was dubbed the “Polar Park.” Opening day in late November 1989 featured a demonstration by professional snowboarders Damian Sanders, Terry Kidwell, Noah Salasnek, Mike and Tina Basich and others. The event was covered by <a href="https://www.thrashermagazine.com">Thrasher Magazine</a> International Snowboard Magazine and local media.</P>

         <h2>Renting Equipment cost</h2>
         <p>You can get a beginner rental package for around $40 a day. This will include boots, bindings, and the board. A helmet is normally extra, but they’re typically less than $10 a day. </p>
         <P>Depending on what US resort you’re heading to, prices will vary slightly. At the popular resorts in Vail, Telluride, and Breckenridge, you’re looking at about $60 to $80 to rent the board, boots, and a helmet for one day. At smaller, less popular resorts, those prices are a little cheaper—around $40 to $50 a day.</P>

         <h2>Best deals for begginers</h2>
         <p>This is what you should look into for your very first time. You’ll get the best value for your money, you won’t have to spend hours trying to find the perfect snowboard to buy, and you might even have a group lesson included in the <a href="http://ski-bigbear.com/rental-packages">lift + rental package.</a>  </p>
         <P>Even some of the best resorts offer affordable packages. Trying out snowboarding in the Lake Tahoe region would cost you about $140 and this includes an equipment rental, day lift pass, and a lesson. If you don’t feel the need to travel, check out the resorts close by. You’ll most likely be able to find packages around $70 that will give you what you need to learn snowboarding.</P>
